            <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
              in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>

            <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

            <p>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
              learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
            <p>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
              gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
              junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
              an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

            <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
            <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
              professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
              did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
              project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
              could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
              experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
              100% recommend! ”</p>
